                    <p>
                        ROBLOX Corporation (“ROBLOX”) is an online virtual world and building game. Your
                        privacy is important to us; this is why we created this Privacy Policy so that you are aware of
                        what information is collected, how we use it and who we share it with. Our offices are located at
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        60 East Third Avenue, suite 201
                        <br/>
                        San Mateo, California, 94401.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        This privacy policy covers the site <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140509172655/http://www.roblox.com/" target="_blank">www.roblox.com</a> and our Mobile App.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        ROBLOX works like this:
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        • a user creates a username and a virtual character that is his or her identity in the ROBLOX world
                        <br/>
                        • users interact with other users through in-game chat, personal messaging (site
                        contained), and user forums; privacy settings allow users or parents to restrict
                        communications with other users
                        <br/>
                        • each user is given one or more pieces of virtual real estate on which they can
                        build houses, cars, machines, or anything else you can build with building blocks;
                        these places are called “games”
                        <br/>
                        • users search for, find, and play games made by other users; they play these games
                        with other users from around the world, and are identified only by their virtual
                        character name
                        <br/>
                        • users earn tickets and/or ROBUX, our virtual currency; users earn these in a variety
                        of ways, and use them to buy items for their characters, including virtual hats,
                        shirts, and pants; users can also sell these items, earning tickets and/or ROBUX
                        <br/>
                        • users can purchase premium services, including: Builder’s Club, a monthly subscription
                        that grants the user more virtual places and a daily allowance, among other things;
                        user may also purchase ROBUX with which they may buy virtual goods on the site
                        <br/>
                        • users may sign up to receive our monthly newsletter; they may opt-out at any time by 
                        following the unsubscribe link located at the bottom of each communication.
                    </p>
                    <h2>
                        Requested Information</h2>
                    <p>
                        ROBLOX users may play as guests; in this mode, users remain anonymous and interact
                        with the website and game in Menu Chat Mode – no free chat, no personal messaging
                        to or from users, no posting to the forums, and other restrictions designed to prevent
                        users from sharing personal information, intentional or otherwise. As guests, users
                        are unable to save play statistics, accumulate points, share models, or participate
                        in our virtual economy.</p>
                    <p>
                        Users wishing to save statistics, share models, and participate in the economy are
                        required to enter a username and password. We advise users to create a username
                        that does not reflect their own name nor reveal personally identifiable information.
                        We also advise users to pick a password that is not easy to guess, and to not share
                        that password. For security reasons, we store passwords in encrypted form.</p>
                    <p>
                        User Names are used for participating in site features and are not used to identify 
                        individual users outside of their activities on our site. Usernames are not passed 
                        along to 3rd parties except in the case where a purchase is made to be credited to the 
                        account. In this case our purchasing vendor is given the account name in order to 
                        credit the account when the transaction is completed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        All users are asked for, but are not required to give, an email address on signup. 
                        Under 13 users are required to give us a parent email, which is then verified, in 
                        order to receive the ROBLOX newsletter. Under 13 users who wish to change or add 
                        an email address to their account must contact ROBLOX via email at <span class="SL_swap" id="CsEmailLink"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140509172655/mailto:info@roblox.com">info@roblox.com</a></span>. 
                        If there is no verified parent email address they are required to provide us with 
                        one which is then verified in order to proceed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Registered users who are under 13 after first signing up are put into Privacy Mode. 
                        Privacy Mode limits who may interact with a user outside of games and limits the user 
                        to a whitelist-filtered language system in all public areas of the site. To opt-in 
                        to black-list filtered free-chat mode users must have their parents contact ROBLOX 
                        Customer Service for assistance by writing to <span class="SL_swap" id="CsEmailLink"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140509172655/mailto:info@roblox.com">info@roblox.com</a></span>.  ROBLOX requires a 
                        verified email address for the parents in order to change this setting. In addition, 
                        ROBLOX uses the verified parent email address to notify parents of other change requests 
                        such as receiving newsletters and participation in certain activities on the site.
                        </p>
                    <p>
                        All text on the site is filtered proactively to remove references to addresses, emails, 
                        phone numbers, age, and other personally identifiable information regardless of security 
                        and privacy settings. All text is also filtered for profanity, phishing, and adult or 
                        suggestive content. Our system is a combination of human and automated processes; like 
                        all filtering technology, our processes are not 100% effective.
                        </p>
                    <p>
                        Users wishing to purchase Builders Club or ROBUX are required to enter billing
                        information, including name, billing address, credit card or PayPal number, and
                        billing email. For children under 13, we request the parent’s billing information.
                        Billing information is retained to support customer service inquiries, but we do
                        not retain the full credit card number.</p>
                    <p>
                        If you (or your child) choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about
                        our site, we will ask you for your friend’s name. We will automatically
                        send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site; ROBLOX
                        does not store this information.</p>
                    <p>
                        If your child opts-in to receiving our monthly newsletter we will send you a notice 
                        at the email address provided during the sign up process in order to allow you to 
                        opt them out of receiving it if you wish to do so. You may opt your child out at any 
                        time by clicking the opt-out link in the newsletter verification email. We use your 
                        child’s username to send them service related messages and allow other users of the 
                        site to communicate with them. If you no longer wish to allow your child to receive 
                        such communications please contact us at <span class="SL_swap" id="CsEmailLink"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140509172655/mailto:info@roblox.com">info@roblox.com</a></span> or update their communications 
                        within their account. We do not collect any Personal Information from children other 
                        than the parent’s email address, and a username and password. 
                        </p>
                    <p>
                        We do not ask you for, access, or track any location based information from your 
                        mobile device at any time while downloading or using our Mobile Application or Services.

                        onto and movement within the ROBLOX website. This helps us credit advertisers appropriately,
                        and measure the health and effectiveness of our website. For example, we use tracking
                        to determine if new page designs are user friendly or too complicated. Our tracking

                        being used, IP address, and information regarding the Internet service provider.

                        Options for Parents
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                         When a child enters a parent’s email address during signup, the parent receives an email 
                         notification of the account creation and an invitation to review chat and privacy settings 
                         for the account. The parent may also provide their consent to allow their child to receive 
                         targeted ads on our site at this time. </p>
                    <p>
                        A parent receiving a verification email has two options. First, the parent can choose not to 
                        respond; in this case, the child remains with all default privacy settings and whitelisted 
                        chat options. Second, the parent can choose to click the link in the email and review the settings; 
                        in this case, the child may be opted-in to free (but filtered) text communications, including 
                        free-text chat and personal messaging (site limited), forum posts, and site commentary. A child 
                        can send an email request to their parent to change the settings at any time.</p>
                    <p>
                        Requests for changes to an account can be made by contacting <span class="SL_swap" id="CsEmailLink"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140509172655/mailto:info@roblox.com">info@roblox.com</a></span>. Parents can close 
                        a child’s account by contacting ROBLOX customer service at info@roblox.com. This hides the account 
                        from all other ROBLOX users and outside parties. The account data is not deleted, but retained 
                        internally for three purposes. Billing information and transaction histories are retained to resolve 
                        subsequent billing disputes and inquiries. Public domain content is retained for use by the community 
                        – e.g. a virtual shirt sold by the child to another user is kept in the system because the recipient 
                        now “owns” a copy of that article. Finally, user account history is retained to support subsequent customer 
                        service inquiries. All retained data for a closed account is private and visible only to employees of ROBLOX.</p>
                        <p>
                        We may store the date of birth of your child and graduate a player to have more Web site 
                        access once they turn 13. We will notify the parent once their child has reached 13 and 
                        may prompt the child to then provide us with their email address the next time they sign 
                        into their account.  If your child opts-in to receive our monthly newsletter we will send 
                        you a notice (to the email address your child provides for you). We will only collect your 
                        child’s email address for the sole purpose of sending them the newsletter.
