                    password or personal information (such as your name, address or phone number), please
                    let us know immediately at <span class="SL_swap" id="CsEmailLink"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140509172806/mailto:info@roblox.com">info@roblox.com</a></span>

                    5. If you cheat on ROBLOX games or use cheat programs, including non-ROBLOX software
                    or programs, to play the games we will freeze your account.

                    6. If you create a&nbsp;game, author a model, or&nbsp;write something that catches
                    our eye on a message board,&nbsp;we might want to use it on the site or elsewhere
                    when talking about the site. If you're under age 18, remember to <b>ALWAYS</b> check
                    with your parents before you send anything to us or post anything on the site! By
                    sending in your content and comments, you (and your parents) are agreeing that it's
                    okay to repeat on the site and elsewhere what you say, and it's even all right for
                    us to use it in an ad. So, this means we can use it in any way we want, anywhere,
                    until the end of time.

                    7. By using ROBLOX software you agree to allow ROBLOX to collect, use, and store data from your
                    computer of a non-personal nature such as Operating System, application software and peripheral 
                    software, in order to identify and address technical and other issues that might occur during its use.
